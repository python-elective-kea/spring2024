You are supposed to listen to the podcasts and learn and create your own Machine Learning code from what they talk about in the podcast series. 

You will not be able to finnish these exercises right away, but the whole exercises series is also meant to be done in smaler steps, and is supposed to take 3 weeks or more.

When finnished you should have a good basic understanding of Machine learning concepts, and you should also have had a whole lot of hands on experience in creating your own Machine learning algorithms. 

Underneath you see a table containing all the episodes of the podcasts, a short descriptions of the learning outcome of each episode and a description of what kind of task you should have fulfiled before going on. (this is the actual exercises.)

# Do the following task using the os module

1. create a folder and name the folder 'os_exercises.'                                                  
2. In that folder create a file. Name the file 'exercise.py'                                                                            
3. get input from the console and write it to the file.                                                 
    * In VSCode and using Notebooks the console will pop up in the top of the editor. So ```input()``` will propt the user for input, and i VScode this is in the top of the editor. 
4. repeat step 2 and 3 (name the file something else).

Session 1 - Introduction to python
==================================

This first week of this elective will be used for introducing this elective and making sure that you all have the software needed to follow along.

The first part of today will be an "overview" and "installation" day. We need to be on the same level before we start.   

In the second part you will get an overview of the python language and you will start to get familiar with the language and the development enviroment. We will focus this first lesson on strings and string manipulations, functions and on the "look and feel" of a python script file.

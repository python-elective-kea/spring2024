# Exam Synopsis (Template)

Below are a few examples of how you could write your synopsis. These are all meant to serve as inspiration. You should craft one in your own words; it doesn't necessarily have to focus on the exact topics I've written about, but can encompass anything that aligns with the overall topics.

## 1. Pythons datastructures
No example

## 2. Pythonic OOP
### Version 1
In my presentation, I will focus on encapsulation and how it is achieved through the use of properties. I will provide some practical examples, starting with public variables and demonstrating how to get and set them. Following this, I will illustrate how we can incorporate properties into our classes to achieve encapsulation without making changes to the existing user code. Suggested topics we could discuss following my presentation include the "property built-in function" and an exploration of its internal workings.

## 3. Functions in python (Build-in functions, functions in general, decorators e.g)
### Version 1
A list of Python's built-in functions can be found here: Python Built-in Functions.
In my presentation, I will demonstrate how to utilize a selection of these functions, emphasizing their ease of use and how they enhance user interaction with the language. Furthermore, I will demonstrate how to integrate these uniform interfaces with one's own objects using data model methods. 

## 4. Data analyse & visualization 
No example

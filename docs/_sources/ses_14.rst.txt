* `Exam description <exam.html#the-exam>`_

We will also do 1 or 2 exam simulations at the blackboard. 

2 of you should prepare a 10 minutes presentation (like the one you do at the actual exam). And the I will ask you questions for 10 minutes (like the ones i do at the actual exam). 

After this you should all have a good idea of how the exam will be. 

So please prepare a 10 minutes presentation before this class if you would like to be the "guinea pig"

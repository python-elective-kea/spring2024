Ex2:
----

Use your third-semester Software Construction exam project (or something else from your third semester).    
You should create a Flask API (backend), using a SQLite database, instead of the Spring Boot API you created last semester.    
You should not change anything in the JavaScript frontend you created last semester.    

The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with Flask development and to compare it with Spring Boot.

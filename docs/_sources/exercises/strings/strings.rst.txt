String exercises
================

You can find the exercises in a Jupyter Notebook file string1.ipynb and string2.ipynb 
in the ```code_from_today``` repository that you have cloned from github.

If you can not find those files, you can also find the exercises below.
Create a string1.py and copy/Paste the code below into a cell in that file. 
Then do the same for string2.py. 

Do the exercises and run it. When the tests all pass, you have solved the exercise.

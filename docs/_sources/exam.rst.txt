The exam
--------

The exam consist of 2 elements: 

* Hand in of an "outline", or "exam synopsis", and an 
* Oral exam.

Hand-in a synopsis:
*******************

Some weeks before the oral examination you should hand in a exam synopsis on wiseflow. If you fail to do so, you will not be able to attend the oral exam. The synopsis should follow these requirements:

* One A4 page (all topics should be on one page!)
* Give a short overview of what you will present at your exam.
* (`You can see and example template here <notebooks/exam_synopsis_template.md>`_.

Remember, a good synopsis or "abstract" clearly and concisely presents your topic, the purpose of your presentation, and the main points you will cover. It makes it easier for those assessing you to follow your presentation and judge you fairly.

Oral exam:
**********

* Prior to the exam you should have prepared a 10 minutes presentation for each of the 3 topics. At the beginnig of the examination you then randomly pick a topic to focus on for your examination.
* Do a 10 minutes presentation with code examples for the picked topic.
* After your presentation 12 minutes examination within this topic and other related topics.

----------
Use of LLM
----------
I expect that you have used some kind of LLM during this semester and also that you have used it to prepare for your exam, both the hand-in part and what you present at the actual examination. So you do not have to hide it.

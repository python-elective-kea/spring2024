Session 5 - Utilities and Modules
=================================

.. danger::
        This lecture was cancelled, but the content will be covered during several of the next sessions. I have also added an extra session at the end of the semester, although it will cover a different topic.

Today, we will continue working with modules, focusing specifically on a third-party module called 'BeautifulSoup' used for webscrabing and a like. Additionally, you will learn how to persistently save your installed modules (done using pip install) and save your requirements for version control of your projects packages.


.. tip::
        Preperation
        
        * Familiarize yourself with the https://pypi.org/ repository.
        *  
        
        Time in class
        
        * First we will talk about your mandatory assignment from last week, including the questions you have handed in on Fronter.
        * Afterwards we will start out by doing this exercise in class: `Students Flaks api exercise <https://github.com/python-elective-kea/students_flaks_api_exercise>`_
        * Afterwards we go through this `Notebook from teachings <notebooks/notes_requirements_webscrabing.ipynb>`_

        Homework
        * If you did not finnish ex3, then this should be done at home.  

Learning goals
--------------
After this week you will be able to:
      
        - understand the idea behinde the  :code:`if __name__ == '__main__':` syntax
        - Find and use 3rd party modules.
        - Save and Share your projects dependencies.
        - Work with the module BeautifullSoup for webscrabing.

Materials
---------
* `Notebook from teachings <notebooks/notes_requirements_webscrabing.ipynb>`_

Ex 2: Create your an app with 3rd. party modules installed
**********************************************************

Create an app from scratch, which should include some kind of 3rd party module. The scope should not be bigger than you can finnish this exercise in 30 minutes. The focus is not on the functionallity of the application, but on having a project with dependencies. Your job is to make sure that anyone ing your app in future can be sure to have the right dependencies installed to run the code.

About this elective
===================

This elective is one of the three you have chosen for your fourth semester in your computer science education. Its aim is to make you a better and more clear-thinking programmer.

This elective will not primarily focus on creating applications for specific tasks. Although you will certainly be able to apply your skills and knowledge from this course to develop applications, our main goal is not centered on application production.

In contrast, you will learn python along with strengthening foundational programming concepts and enhancing problem-solving skills. We will look at algorithms and data structures, ensuring that you develop a robust understanding of the principles underlying effective programming. This deep dive is designed to equip you with a solid foundation that is essential for tackling complex programming challenges. 

Why use python for this?

Because Python has a relatively clear and straightforward data model that makes it easier to focus on the task than on the language itself. Again, as a side effect, you should gain a solid understanding of the language, which will help you in your future careers when solving tasks with Python as the programming language

So, to sum up, the focus is on becoming a better and more clear-thinking programmer, with Python serving as the tool for this purpose. The goal is not to create large applications using Python.

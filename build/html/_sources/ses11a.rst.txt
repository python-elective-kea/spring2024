Session 11.2 - Python web devlopment
====================================
Today we will work with web api development using the Python light weight web framework Flask.
We will also look at how module requirements and depency management are handled in Python.

        Preperation
                You are welcome to have a look at these tutorials, but it is also ok if you do not.

        Time in class
                * We will start by doing 'Ex1: outdated requirements'.     
                * Then we will analyse the code in this exercise, and from this get an idea of what a Flask application will contain of code.    
                * Then you should all work on Ex 2 for the rest of the class.    
                        * You are free to do it in any way you wish. You already have the requirements for this exercise from your 3rd semester, and a way to solve this is by giving the requirements to Chatgpt and ask it for a solution done using Flask. Anyway you do it is fine.)

Ex2:
----

Use your third-semester Software Construction exam project (or something else from your third semester).    
You should create a Flask API (backend), using a SQLite database, instead of the Spring Boot API you created last semester.    
You should not change anything in the JavaScript frontend you created last semester.    

The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with Flask development and to compare it with Spring Boot.

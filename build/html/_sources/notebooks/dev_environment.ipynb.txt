    "The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Often referred to as the \"Python shell,\" it provides an interactive environment where you can write and run Python commands one at a time. This interactive mode is an excellent tool for learning, testing, and debugging.\n",
    "You will not create any lasting files in the interpretor. It is a \"write one line of code and execute it\" tool.\n",
    "This is alike the terminal in your browser which you probably have use when debugging javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the Python interpreter by typing python in your command-line interface (CLI). \n",
